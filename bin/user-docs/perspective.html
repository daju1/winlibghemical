<h1>2.1.2 Changing the 3D-views</h1>
 
<p>On the left toolbar there are 7 tools to change the way the current project
is  displayed. Ghemical stores each atom a point in the cartesian coordinate
system. The first point is The X-axis is parallel to the bottom of the window,
the Y-axis is parallel to  the side of the window and the Z axis is pointing
out of the screen. The molecule is from the perspective of a camera  focused
on all or part of the molecule.</p>
 
<p> </p>
<ul>
 	<li>
    <h2>Zoom</h2>
 This moves the camera either further from or closer to the molecule,  	effectively
zooming in or out of the molecule. To operate the zoom, click on the Zoom
button 	on the toolbar. Left click on the view window and hold the mouse
button down. Moving the 	mouse up will zoom out of the molecule and moving
the mouse down will zoom out of the 	molecule. Releasing the mouse button
stops the zooming process. </li>
 	<li>
    <h2>Translate XY</h2>
 This tool moves the molecule in the XY plane. To operate  	it, click on
the Translate XY button. Left click on the view window and hold the mouse 
	button down. The molecule will be translated in the direction that the mouse
is moved 	(up, down, left or right).</li>
 	<li>
    <h2>Translate Z</h2>
 This will move the molecule along the Z-axis. To operate it,  	click on
the Translate Z button. Left click on the view window and hold the mouse
button 	down. Moving the mouse up or down will translate the molecule. This
is similar to zooming 	the molecule, except in this case the molecule will
be translated instead of the camera.</li>
 	 	<li>
    <h2>Orbit XY</h2>
 This tool will rotate the molecule around the X or Y axis of the  	focus
point of the camera. To use this tool, click on the Orbit XY button. Left 
	click on the view window and hold the mouse button down. Moving the mouse
button 	up or down will rotate the molecule around the X axis, moving the
mouse button left 	or right will rotate the molecule around the Y axis. Releasing
the mouse button ends 	the orbit operation. 	</li>
 	<li>
    <h2>Orbit Z</h2>
 This tool will rotate the molecule around the X or Y axis of the  	focus
point of the camera. To use this tool, click on the Orbit XY button. Left 
	click on the view window and hold the mouse button down. Moving the mouse
button 	up or down will rotate the molecule around the X axis, moving the
mouse button left 	or right will rotate the molecule around the Y axis. Releasing
the mouse button ends 	the orbit operation. </li>
 	<li>
    <h2>Rotate XY</h2>
 This tool performs the same function as the Orbit XY tool 	except rotation
is performed around the camera and not the focus point. It's operation 	is
identical to the Orbit XY tool.</li>
 	<li>
    <h2>Rotate Z</h2>
 This tool performs the same function as the Orbit Z tool 	except rotation
is performed around the camera and not the focus point. It's operation 	is
identical to the Orbit Z tool. </li>
 
</ul>
 
<h2>Moving only some atoms</h2>
 
<p> It is possible to move only the selected atoms. To do this, select the
atoms you want to move with the Select tool from the left toolbar and click
on the tool that you want to use (Translate XY,  Orbit XY...). Now hold down
the shift button perform the translation, rotation or orbit. Only the selected
atoms will be affected by the operation.</p>
