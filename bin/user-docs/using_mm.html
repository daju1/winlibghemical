<h1>2.1.1 Quick Start : modelling Ethane</h1>
         
<p>This section covers the features required to build a simple molecule (Ethane)
  using ghemical.</p>
         
<h3>Step 1</h3>
         
<p>After starting ghemical you must open a new project. To do this, click
  on the file menu and select "mm1pg - molecular mechanics"</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
         
<p>Select Draw from the toolbar on the left hand side. The Draw tool is the
  method that all bonds and atoms are added with.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
         
<p>Now begin to add atoms and bonds to your molecule. The default atom type
  is carbon. To add a single atom to the molecule, single click on the location
  you would like to put the atom. </p>

<p> To draw a bond between two atoms, single left click on the first atom
  in the bond, drag the mouse  over to the second atom and then release the
  mouse button. You may also create atoms and bonds at the same time by left
  clicking on an existing atom, dragging the mouse to where you want to place 
  the second atom and then releasing the mouse button.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
         
<p> Now that the carbon backbone is created, we can now add the hydrogens.
  To do this, we must first change the atom type from carbon to hydrogen.
This  is done selecting the periodic table button from the top toolbar.</p>
      <img src="images/periodic_button.png"
 alt="Screenshot of Set current element button.">
         
<p> A dialog box of the periodic table will appear. To select an element,
  simply click on the button  corresponding to it. All further atoms drawn
 on the molecule will be of this element until it is  changed by the same
method. In this example, hydrogen is selected. This menu can also be  opened
by right clicking on the view windows, selecting Settings from the popup
menu and then selecting Set Current Element.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
         
<p>In this step additional hydrogens are added to the molecule in same way
  the second carbon atom was added. This process can be simplified using
the   Add Hydrogens tool.</p>

 alt="Screenshot of hydrogens being added to the carbon atoms.">
         
<p>Although the all the correct atoms and bonds are present, the molecule
  is not in the most stable conformation. Ghemical can attempt to do this
for  you using the Geometry Optimization tool.</p>
         
<p>You can also change the bond type by clicking on the "Set the current
bond type" button on the top tool bar.</p>
     <img src="images/change_bond_select.png" width="325" height="238"
 alt="Screenshot of the selection of the change bond type option.">
         
<p>This button will launch a dialog box that lets you select the bond type
  from a list of single, conjugated double and triple. All further bonds
that   you create will be on the type that you select until you change the
bond  type again. Conjugated bonds are drawn as a single solid tube with
a  second  dashed tube parallel to it. Double bonds and triple bonds are
drawn as two  and three  parallel tubes respectively. This menu can also
be opened by right  clicking on the view windows,  selecting Settings from
the popup menu and  then selecting Set Current Bond. </p>
