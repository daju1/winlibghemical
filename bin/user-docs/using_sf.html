<h2> 2.3 The Simplified Force Field</h2>
SORRY, THESE DOCS ARE OBSOLETE!<br>
The "mm2gp" type project is for simplified protein models<a
 href="references.html#ra">[1]</a>.        
<p>Protein molecules are modelled using 1-3 "virtual atoms" per amino acid
    residue in this kind of model. Several chains and disulphide brides are
  supported, but non-natural amino acids are not. Files can be imported in
 the PDB file format. The force field is fully functional with an initial
parameter set, and algorithms for geometry optimization and molecular dynamics
are available.  </p>
             
<p>There are no sophisticated tools for model building yet, but they might
    be coming later. </p>
