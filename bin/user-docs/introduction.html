<h3> <a name="intro"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
      Ghemical is a computational chemistry software package released under 
 the  GNU GPL. It means that full source code of the package is available, 
 and users are free to study and modify the package. If you wonder about spelling
 in the package name, yes it's intentionally a bit "wrong" (originally inspired
 by the funny name of the excellent spreadsheet program Gnumeric), but feel
  free to pronounce it just in a way that is comfortable!       
<p>This document describes the user interface of the Ghemical for GNOME desktop 
  environment, as well as the main features of different components of the 
 program. Ghemical for GNOME is a standard GNOME MDI application, so the generic
 features of GNOME MDI applications and user interfaces apply to this program
 as well.</p>
    The main elements of the user interface are the main menu and the main 
toolbar.<br>
    <br>
       
<div align="center"><img src="images/mainmenu.png" alt="the main menu"
 width="392" height="33">
    <br>
    </div>
       
<p>The items in the main menu cover the features: </p>
         
<p></p>
   
<ul>
    <li>File : Create new projects, Open projects from files, Exit the program.</li>
    <li>Windows : Change the GNOME MDI mode settings from the system defaults,
 and view a list of currently open project files.</li>
    <li>Help : Display the About Box and this User's Manual. </li>
   
</ul>
           
<center>      
<p><img src="images/maintools.png" height="50" width="883"
 alt="the main toolbar">
     </p>
     </center>
            
<p>The buttons of the the main toolbar are mouse tool buttons. One of these
 buttons   is always pressed down, and this determines what operations are
 done when   the user handles the models with mouse. The left mousebutton
always triggers   the mouse tool operations, and the tools and operations
are the following:<br>
  </p>
   
<ul>
    <li>Draw : Add atoms or bonds to the model, or change the types of existing
   atoms or bonds in the model.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Erase : Remove atoms or bonds from the model.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Select : Mark atoms selected in the model. Selecting an already selected
   atom will de-select it.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Zoom : Change the zooming of this 3D-view.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Translate tools: Translate the "camera" which produces this 3D-view.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Orbit tools: Orbit the "camera" which produces this 3D-view around
 it's  focus point. Practically this means that you can rotate the molecules
 in your 3D-view using these tools.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Rotate tools : Turn the "camera" which produces this 3D-view. Practically
   this is means that you "turn your head" in the 3D-landscape that consists
   of the system you study. Use these tools with caution; you might easily
 "lost" your system if it's a single molecule.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Measure : Measure distances, angles or torsions. Click a sequence 
of  atoms  (like with the Select tool) to define distance, angle or torsion. 
  </li>
   
</ul>
              
<p>In addition to these standard features some of the tools have some special
   features:<br>
 </p>
 
<ul>
   <li>Select : The selection tool can, in addition to atoms, select objects
   (for example: spotlights, color planes and color surfaces) that are rendered
   as opaque (non-transparent) objects. In order to select transparent or
invisible  objects, you have to use the "project view".&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Translate tools and Orbit tools: These tools work differently if you 
 hold  down the modifier key SHIFT before you use the tool. In this case the
 tool  affects not to the "camera" but to the currently selected object or
 to the  currently selected set of atoms in the model. Using the SHIFT key
 and these  tools you can translate and/or rotate the objects or atoms/molecules 
 in the  model. In addition to the SHIFT modifier key, the Translate tools 
 have an  another modifier key CTRL. This makes the tool use the object's 
internal coordinate axis in the translation instead of the camera's coordinate 
axis. Therefore, by using the key combination SHIFT+CTRL with the Translate 
Z tool, you can easily "scan" your model using a color plane object.<br>
   </li>
 
</ul>
 
<p> </p>
         
<p>In addition to the above topics, the following small tips and tricks are 
  worth mentioning:</p>
 
<ul>
   <li>In all 3D-views, the right mouse button will display a popup-menu. 
These   popup-menus can be different in different types of models, making 
different   features available in different models (for example, molecular 
mechanics  models have different features available than quantum-mechanical 
models).&nbsp;</li>
   <li>There is a status bar visible in the program, but it's not very actively
   used yet. Many parts of the program do still their output to the console
  window where the program was started. We are working on this, but it's
going   to take some time before all these things are fixed. So, in the meantime
 you are adviced to start the program from a console window, and to keep
that   console window visible. Sometimes you even might be asked for input
in the   console window!&nbsp;</li>
   <li>You are adviced to use the "Notebook" MDI mode of GNOME to make the
 handling  of multiple documents as easy as possible.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>The main menu and the toolbar support a "drag and drop" feature: just
  click the "handle" of the menu or toolbar using left mouse button, "drag"
  it outside the main window, and "drop" it to suitable place.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>All different "views" of a project are grouped into a single "notebook"
   of the project; there is a separate "page" for each view. The 3D-graphics
   views can also be detached from this notebook; take a look at the "Views"
   section of the popup-menu. Using the "detach" option you can use multiple
   views simultaneously, which is otherwise difficult.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>The "volume rendering" object is different from all other objects
because   it is connected to a "camera", and actively orients itself to this
camera   each time the camera is translated or rotated.</li>
 
</ul>
<h3> <a name="changes_100"></a>1.1 Changes from version 1.00</h3>
      The most important change from version 1.00 is that the separate MM/QM/simplified
project types are united into a single project type. The type of the calculations
are now selected from the "Compute/Setup..." druid from the popup menu.<br>
