<h1>2.1.9 Molecular Dynamics</h1>
 
<p> The molecular dynamics feature allows the simulation of the Newtonian
mechanics of a molecule. The molecule should be Geometry Optimized before
starting the simulation. When the Molecular Dynamics option is selected from
the popup menu a dialog  box will appear.</p>

<p> This box will contain four fields. The "Number of steps :" is the number 
of iterations the simulation should continue for. A large number of steps
will allow the  simulation to cover a greater portion of the conformational
space, however it it will also take longer to compute. The default number
of steps is 10000.</p>
  
<p>The second field is the temperature. A higher temperature will mean that
the bonds can be stretched and bent further than a lower temperature, thus
allowing the molecule to adopt different conformations. The default temperature
is 300 K.</p>
 
<p> The "Time Step" field is the length of time between each step in fentoseconds.
A small  length of time will be more accurate and provide a more detailed
view the the dynamics of the molecule, however a smaller area of conformational
space will be shown. The default  setting is 0.5 fs.</p>
  
<p>The "Trajectory File" field is the file where Ghemical will save the data
generated by this  calculation. You can review the trajecorty file afterwards
using the MD Trajectory viewer.   The field should typically be changed to
a filename related to the molecule you are working with.  (ie ethane1.traj).
The default setting is untitled.traj.</p>
 
<p> Once you are done changing the settings press the Ok button to start
the calculation.  Depending on the molecule and the settings you chose this
calculation may take a considerable amount of time.</p>
  
<p>You will see the bonds of the molecule stretching and bending to adopt
different conformations in the graphical window. In the console window the
amount of time  (in fentoseconds) that the simulation has run for will be
printed on each line as well as the temperature in Kelvin (this is calculated
from the kinetic energy of the  molecule), the potential energy and the total
energy (kinetic plus potential energies).</p>
  
<p>After the calculation has completed you may view it in the <a
