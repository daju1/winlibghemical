You can compile and install this package using commands

	./configure
	make
	make install

In installation only the libmopac library is installed, not the standalone
mopac7 executable which is also generated in the compilation stage.

You can use the run_mopac7 script to start the standalone mopac7 application,
for example to run some of the test files:

	./run_mopac7 tests/force
