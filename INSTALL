	REQUIREMENTS:
	-------------

The ghemical package is dependent on "libghemical" package, in addition
to the packages/files that are needed to compile and run programs at
the GTK2 platform.

You can get "libghemical-1.90.tgz" or newer from

	http://bioinformatics.org/ghemical/download.html

Other software/packages that are needed to compile and run this program
are:

	g++			gcc version 2.95.4 or later
	make			GNU Make version 3.76.1
	pkg-config		pkg-config-0.15
	
	glut			glut 3.6
	GTK2			gtk+-2.0 version 2.4.0 or newer
	GtkGLExt		gtkglext-1.0 version 1.0.5 or newer
	LibGlade		libglade-2.0 version 2.4.0 or newer
	GThread			gthread-2.0 version 2.4.0 or newer (opt)

In short, any up-to-date Linux installation like Redhat 9.0, Mandrake 9.0
or Debian 3.0 should work, if the necessary development packages (that
contain the header files) are also present, in addition to the standard
packages (that contain the libraries).


	INSTALLATION:
	-------------
	
Simple set of commands

	./configure
	make
	make install		[run as root user]

will produce an executable program and install it into your system. For more
options and information you can try

	./configure --help

Options include creating a multithreaded user interface, and a bonobo-2 server
application (THIS IS A BIT BROKEN NOW BUT I TRY TO FIX IT SOON).

If at configuration step you get stuck and see some error messages about
PKG_CONFIG, please try the following tricks (and re-try ./configure):

	export PKG_CONFIG=pkg-config
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

Also if problems appear you might want to try updating the configuration
files using commands at the top of the source tree (and re-try ./configure):

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader
	automake
	libtoolize -f

The "make install"-command will copy the executable and some extra files to
their proper places so that the program can be run anywhere. After you have
installed the program you can click the item "Help/Help" from the main menu
to read the User's Manual (highly recommended).

In the "bin/examples"-directory there are some useful example molecules, and
in the "small-utilities"-directory there are... well, some small utilities.

Enjoy!!!
