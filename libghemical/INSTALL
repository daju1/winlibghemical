	REQUIREMENTS:
	-------------

The libghemical package is optionally dependent on "mopac7", "mpqc" and
"OpenBabel" packages, in addition to the packages/files that are needed
to compile and run UNIX console programs and/or libraries.

You can get "mopac7-1.00.tgz" or newer from

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mopac7/

and "mpqc-1.2.5.tgz" or newer from

	http://www.mpqc.org/download.php

and "openbabel-1.100.2.tar.gz" or newer from

	http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/

Other software/packages that are needed to compile and run this library
are:

	g++			gcc version 2.95.4 or later
	f2c			f2c version 19991025-1 (for mopac7)
	make			GNU Make version 3.76.1
	pkg-config		pkg-config-0.15

In short, any up-to-date Linux installation like Redhat 9.0, Mandrake 9.0
or Debian 3.0 should work, if the necessary development packages (that
contain the header files) are also present, in addition to the standard
packages (that contain the libraries).


	INSTALLATION:
	-------------

Simple set of commands

	./configure
	make
	make install		[run as root user]

will produce a library version in which all the optional dependencies
mentioned above are disabled. You can enable the options by adding the
following statements to the configuration scriopt command line:

	./configure --enable-mopac7 --enable-mpqc --enable-openbabel

For more options and information you can try

	./configure --help

If at configuration step you get stuck and see some error messages about
PKG_CONFIG, please try the following tricks (and re-try ./configure):

	export PKG_CONFIG=pkg-config
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

Also if problems appear you might want to try updating the configuration
files using commands at the top of the source tree (and re-try ./configure):

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader
	automake
	libtoolize -f

The "make install"-command will copy the library and some extra files to
their proper places so that the library can be used in other programs.
